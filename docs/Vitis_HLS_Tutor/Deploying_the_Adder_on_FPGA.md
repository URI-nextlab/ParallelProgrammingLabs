# Deploying the Adder on FPGA

## Step 1

If you have not used the PYNQ before, check the following link for setup:

-[PYNQ-Z2 Setup Guide](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/pynq_z2_setup.html).

# [Optional] 
(This section assumes familiarity with the official AMD documentation on PYNQ and successful completion of the setup described above.)

To enhance PYNQ's accessibility and functionality, you can directly connect it to the Clemson Campus Network using an Ethernet cable. This approach offers two key benefits:

* Remote access to PYNQ
  
* Simultaneous internet connectivity and PYNQ configuration

Follow these steps to set up this connection:

* First, we need to connect to the PYNQ board via a serial port terminal, such as MobaXterm, using the cable that also supplies power to the board, and we need to set some parameters like below:

  <div align=center><img src="Images/18/6.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

  If we connect the PYNQ successfully, we will see like below:

 <div align=center><img src="Images/18/7.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

* Secondly, we need to know some information about the PYNQ-Z2 board by print ```ifconfig``` like below.

   <div align=center><img src="Images/18/8.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>
   
And we need to copy the address above.
  
* Thirdly, we need to click the link for setup:
-[Clemson Ethernet](https://ccit.clemson.edu/support/current-students/get-connected/ethernet-wired/)

* Then, click the link like below:

  <div align=center><img src="Images/18/2.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>
  
  <div align=center><img src="Images/18/3.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

  <div align=center><img src="Images/18/4.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>
  
We must paste the MAC address in the ```Hardware Address```. We can write something in the ```Description ``` to mark our device. 

* Lastly, if you've already set up your Ethernet connection (e.g., by connecting to Clemson's Ethernet network), you can verify your connection and find your assigned IP address using the ifconfig command. Follow the steps below to ensure everything is properly configured and to check your IP address like below. (Hints: If you do not see your IP address, please wait a few seconds and try checking again. Sometimes it may take a moment for the network to assign an IP address after connecting the Ethernet cable.)

<div align=center><img src="Images/18/17.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/></div>

Once your Ethernet connection is set up and you have verified your IP address, you can proceed to access the entrance page by opening a Web Browser and enter the URL containing your IP address like ```130.127.199.27:9090```. When you press Enter, you should see the entrance page appear, confirming that your connection is properly set up. 

<div align=center><img src="Images/18/18.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

Enter the correct password and click on "Login." If the password is right, you will see the right page like below:

<div align=center><img src="Images/18/19.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

Accessing the school network through connecting to the school's Ethernet cable is currently the most convenient way. Then even if we don't have the board with us, we can still remotely access PYNQ by knowing the board's IP address, provided that the board is connected to the school network and powered on.

## Step 2

Before proceeding, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the concepts of PYNQ, Jupyter Notebook, and Overlays via the website: [PYNQ-Z2](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/pynq_z2_setup.html)

If you already have a basic understanding of using Jupyter on these boards, start by uploading the .bit file and the .hwh file to Jupyter. Then, create a new .ipynb file in the same directory to write your script.
-[Overlay Tutorial](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overlay_design_methodology/overlay_tutorial.html)

## Step 3

Find the address offset of the memory ports (`a`, `b`, and `sum`, in this example). This information can be found in the `xtop_hw.h` file under `solution1/impl/misc/drivers/top_v1_0/src` directory.

## Step 4

Below is the example Python host code to control the FPGA kernel.

```python
import numpy as np
import pynq
from pynq import MMIO

overlay = pynq.Overlay('adder.bit')

top_ip = overlay.top_0
top_ip.signature

a_buffer = pynq.allocate((100), np.int32)
b_buffer = pynq.allocate((100), np.int32)
sum_buffer = pynq.allocate((100), np.int32)

# initialize input
for i in range (0, 100):
    a_buffer[i] = i
    b_buffer[i] = i+5

aptr = a_buffer.physical_address
bptr = b_buffer.physical_address
sumptr = sum_buffer.physical_address

# specify the address
# These addresses can be found in the generated .v file: top_control_s_axi.v
top_ip.write(0x10, aptr)
top_ip.write(0x1c, bptr)
top_ip.write(0x28, sumptr)


# start the HLS kernel
top_ip.write(0x00, 1)
isready = top_ip.read(0x00)

while( isready == 1 ):
    isready = top_ip.read(0x00)

print("Array A:")
print(a_buffer[0:10])
print("\nArray B:")
print(b_buffer[0:10])

print("\nExpected Sum:")
print((a_buffer + b_buffer)[0:10])

print("\nFPGA returns:")
print(sum_buffer[0:10])
```
