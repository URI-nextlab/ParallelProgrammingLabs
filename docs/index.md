# FPGA/SoC/Verilog/HLS

This open-source site is designed to support the educational needs of students, engineers, and enthusiasts in the fields of FPGA/ASIC, SoC, and HLS. The content and lab exercises available here draw upon materials from several reputable sources with modifications, including workshops offered by AMD/Xilinx [link](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/university-program/workshops.html), the "Parallel Programming for FPGAs" course [link](https://pp4fpgas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) at UCSD, "Digital Computer Design" course [link](https://www.coursesidekick.com/electrical-engineering/2115253) at Clemson, and the "Parallel Programming on FPGAs" course [link](https://sharclab.ece.gatech.edu/teaching/2023-spring-fpga/) at Georgia Tech. Educators are encouraged to incorporate these resources into their curriculum.
