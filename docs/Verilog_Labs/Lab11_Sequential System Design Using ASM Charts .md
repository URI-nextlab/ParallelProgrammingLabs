# Lab11_Sequential System Design Using ASM Charts    

## Introduction

Control unit designs may range from simple to highly complex. There are a number of methods to design
and realize control units. Simple control units can be designed using state graphs and state table
methods. Complex control units may be designed using algorithmic charts like flowcharts in
software development. You will be introduced to the Algorithmic State Machine (ASM) chart
technique in this lab.

## ASM Charts

Just as flowcharts are useful in software design, special flowcharts called Algorithmic State Machines
(ASM) are useful in digital systems hardware design. Digital systems typically consist of datapath
processing and the control path. The control path is implemented using state machines, which can be
realized using state graphs. As the control path (behavior) of the system becomes complex, it becomes
increasingly difficult to design the control path using the state graph technique. The ASM charts technique
becomes useful and handy in designing complex and algorithmic circuits. The following diagram shows a
complex digital system partitioned into a controller (to generate the control signals) and the controlled
architecture (data processor). 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v4/1.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/></div>

The model of the Controller (ASM) block in the above figure can be viewed as the combination of Mealy and Moore machines, as shown below.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v4/2.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/></div>

The ASM chart differs from an ordinary flowchart in that specific rules must be followed when constructing the
chart. When these rules are followed, the ASM chart is equivalent to a state graph, and it leads directly to
a hardware realization. The following diagram shows the three main components of an ASM chart. 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v4/3.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/></div>


A state box represents the state of the system. The state box contains a state name and may
contain an output list (just like in a state graph of the Moore machine). A state code may be placed
outside the box at the top (if you want to assign a state code). A decision box always has true and false
branches. The condition placed in the decision box must be a Boolean expression that is evaluated to
determine which branch to take. The conditional output box contains a conditional output list. The
conditional outputs depend on the system's state and the inputs (just like in the Mealy machine). 

The ASM chart is constructed from SM blocks. Each SM block contains exactly one state box, decision boxes, and conditional output boxes associated with that state, as shown below. An SM
block has exactly one entrance path and one or more exit paths. Each SM block describes the machine's
operation during the time that the machine is in that state. A path through an SM block from entrance to
exit is called a link path. 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v4/4.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/></div>

Let us consider an example of a state graph of a sequential network, shown below. This state graph has both Mealy and Moore outputs. The outputs Y1 and Y2 are the Mealy outputs and should be conditional outputs. The Ya, Yb, and Yc are the Moore outputs, so they should be part of the state box. Input
X can either be “0” or “1”; hence, it should be part of the decision box. 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v4/5.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/></div>

The ASM chart of the above state graph is as shown below. 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/v4/6.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/></div>

Once the ASM chart is determined, the conversion to HDL is straightforward. A ```case``` statement can specify what happens in each state. Each condition box corresponds directly to an if statement (or an else if). The following code represents the functionality of the above ASM chart.

```verilog
module asm_chart(input clk, input x, output reg ya, output reg yb, output reg yc, output reg y1, output reg y2);
    // State declaration
    reg [1:0] state, nextstate; // Registers for current and next state
    parameter [1:0] S0=0, S1=1, S2=2; // States encoding
    
    // State Update Block
    always @(posedge clk) // Updates the current state on every positive clock edge
        state <= nextstate;

    // Next State and Mealy Output Logic Block
    always @(state or x) // Determines the next state and Mealy outputs based on current state and input x
    begin
        y1 = 1'b0; // Default Mealy outputs
        y2 = 1'b0;
        case (state) // Decision logic based on current state
            S0: if(x) nextstate = S1; else nextstate = S0; // Transitions from state S0
            S1: if(x) nextstate = S2; else nextstate = S0; // Transitions from state S1
            S2: if(x) begin y2 = 1'b1; nextstate = S1; end else begin y1 = 1'b1; nextstate = S0; end // Transitions from state S2
            default: nextstate = S0; // Default case to avoid latches
        endcase
    end

    // Moore Output Logic Block
    always @(state) // Determines Moore outputs based solely on current state
    begin
        // Resetting all Moore outputs
        ya = 1'b0;
        yb = 1'b0;
        yc = 1'b0;
        // Setting Moore outputs based on current state
        case (state)
            S0: ya = 1'b1; // Output for state S0
            S1: yb = 1'b1; // Output for state S1
            S2: yc = 1'b1; // Output for state S2
            default: begin ya = 1'b0; yb = 1'b0; yc = 1'b0; end // Default case to ensure defined outputs
        endcase
    end
endmodule

```

### Part11-1-1

Design a 3-bit x 3-Bit binary multiplier. The multiplier will output 6-bit
product. The data processor unit will consist of a 3-bit accumulator, a 3-bit
multiplier register, a 3-bit adder, a counter, and a 3-bit shifter. The control
unit will consist of a least-significant-bit (lsb) of the multiplier, a start
signal, a cnt_done signal, and clk as an input. It will generate start, shift,
add, and done signals. Develop an ASM chart for the control unit. Develop
models for the data processor and the control unit. Develop a testbench to
validate the design using the behavioral simulation.

## Sequential System Design Using ASM Chart
We saw how the ASM chart technique can be used in designing control units of sequential machines. Now
we will use the ASM chart technique along with the sequential design principles to design complex
systems. 

### Part11-2-1
Modify the design of 1-1 to perform 4-bit x 4-Bit unsigned multiplication.
You will store the 4-bit multiplicand and multipliers in 32x4 ROM (first 16
locations holding multiplicands and the other 16 locations holding
multipliers).

**lab11_2_1.v**
```verilog
module ROM_4bit(
    input [4:0] address, // 5 bits to cover 0 to 31 addresses
    output reg [3:0] data
);

    // Define the ROM content
    always @(address) begin
        case(address)
            // Define your 16 multiplicands here
            5'd0 : data = 4'b0001; // Example for multiplicand
            5'd1 : data = 4'd11; // Another multiplicand
            5'd2 : data = 4'd2;
            // Add more as needed...

            // Define your 16 multipliers here, starting from address 16 (5'd16)
